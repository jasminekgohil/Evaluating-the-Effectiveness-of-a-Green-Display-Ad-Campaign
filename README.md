# Evaluating-the-Effectiveness-of-a-Green-Display-Ad-Campaign - A Randomized Experiment with ITT and TOT Estimates

This experiment evaluated the effectiveness of a display ad campaign promoting Selene's environmentally friendly practices on sales. Researchers investigated two key questions:
* **Overall Campaign Effect (ITT):** Did the ad campaign, on average, lead to higher sales compared to the control group who didn't see the ads?
* **Effect on Exposed Users (TOT):** Among users who actually saw the ads (treatment group exposed), did their sales increase compared to users in the control group who saw ghost ads (treatment group not exposed)?

**Randomization Check:**
The analysis confirmed successful randomization by comparing user characteristics (country, past sales) between treatment and control groups. There were no statistically significant differences.

**Campaign Effect Analysis:**
* **ITT Estimate:** Pointed to a slightly positive impact on sales in the treatment group, but the confidence interval included zero, indicating the effect might not be statistically significant.
* **TOT Estimate:** Showed a stronger positive impact on sales for users who saw the ads compared to those who didn't. However, the confidence interval also included zero, suggesting some uncertainty about the significance.

**Preferred Estimator:**
The report recommends focusing on the **TOT estimate** for several reasons:
* It considers actual exposure to the ad campaign, aligning better with the campaign's goals of influencing users who see the message.
* It directly assesses the impact on users who might be receptive to Selene's environmental message.
* It accounts for potential non-compliance (users not seeing the ad) in the treatment group.

**Managerial Implications:**
* The results suggest a possible positive impact of the campaign, but more data is needed for conclusive evidence.
* The lack of statistical significance highlights the need for caution when interpreting the findings.
* Consider other factors influencing sales before making decisions based solely on the campaign.
* Evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the campaign compared to other marketing strategies.

**Observational vs. Experimental Analysis:**
Without an experiment, relying solely on observational data (e.g., comparing users who saw ads to those who didn't) can lead to misleading conclusions. Here's why:
* Observational data might show a correlation between ads and sales, but it can't definitively prove that the ads caused the increase. Other factors could be at play.
Selection bias might skew the results if certain users are more likely to see the ads or be influenced by them.
* Unobserved variables not accounted for in the analysis could influence sales and distort the true effect of the campaign.
* Missing counterfactual: Observational data lacks a control group, making it impossible to know what sales would have been without the ads.
* Generalizability: Observational results might not apply to other contexts or user groups.

Overall, while the experiment suggests a potential positive effect of the ad campaign, more data and analysis are needed to confirm its effectiveness. The TOT estimate provides a more targeted assessment of the campaign's impact on users who were exposed to the message.
